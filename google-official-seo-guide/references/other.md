In the context of Google Search, spam refers to techniques used to deceive users or manipulate our Search systems into ranking content highly. Our spam policies help protect users and improve the quality of Search results. To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn't violate Google Search's overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page. These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.

We detect policy-violating practices both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a manual action. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.

If you believe that a site is violating Google's spam policies, let us know by filing a search quality user report. We're focused on developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and we'll use these reports to further improve our spam detection systems.

Our policies cover common spam practices, but Google may act against any type of spam practices we detect.

Cloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users. Examples of cloaking include:

If your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript or images, see our recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without cloaking.

If a site is hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack harder for the site owner to detect. Read more about fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.

If you operate a paywall or a content-gating mechanism, we don't consider this to be cloaking if Google can see the full content of what's behind the paywall just like any person who has access to the gated material and if you follow our Flexible Sampling general guidance.

Doorway abuse is when sites or pages are created to rank for specific, similar search queries. They lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Examples of doorway abuse include:

Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to manipulate search rankings by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to:

## Debugging drops in Google Search traffic

**URL:** https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/debugging-search-traffic-drops#main-causes

**Contents:**
- Debugging drops in Google Search traffic
- Main causes for drops in organic Search traffic
  - Algorithmic update
  - Small drop in position
  - Large drop in position
  - Technical issues
  - Security issues
  - Spam issues
  - Seasonality and changing interests
  - Site moves and migrations

A drop in organic Search traffic can happen for several reasons, and it may not be straightforward to understand what exactly happened to your site. This guide explains how to use the Search Console Performance report and Google Trends to investigate the reasons for a drop in Search traffic and how to address it.

To get an idea of what is affecting your Search traffic, check the sketches in the image. They show roughly what could potentially affect your traffic and how your graph shape would look like.

Large drop from an algorithmic update, site-wide security or spam issue

Technical issue across your site, changing interests

Reporting glitch ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The following sections cover the main causes you should investigate when analyzing a traffic drop. Also make sure to check the Search Console Data Anomalies page to see if there is anything applicable to your site. The drop might be related to a change in the data processing or a logging error.

Google is always improving how it assesses content and updating its search ranking and serving algorithms accordingly; core updates and other smaller updates may change how some pages perform in Google Search results. We post about notable improvements to our systems on our list of ranking updates page; check it to see if there's anything that's applicable to your site.

If you suspect a drop in traffic is due to an algorithmic update, it's important to understand that there might not be anything fundamentally wrong with your content. To determine whether you need to make a change, review your top pages in Search Console and assess how they were ranking:

A small drop in position is when there's a small shift in position in the top results (for example, dropping from position 2 to 4 for a search query). In Search Console, you might see a noticeable drop in traffic without a big change in impressions.

Small fluctuations in position can happen at any time (including moving back up in position, without you needing to do anything). In fact, we recommend avoiding making radical changes if your page is already performing well.

A large drop in position is when you see a notable drop out of the top results for a wide range of terms (for example, dropping from the top 10 results to position 29).

In cases like this, self-assess your whole website overall (not just individual pages) to make sure it's helpful, reliable and people-first. If you've made changes to your site, it may take time to see an effect: some changes c

- Guidelines
  - Don't misrepresent yourself
  - Software guidelines
  - Chrome extension guidelines
  - Mobile application guidelines

Google checks websites to see whether they host software or downloadable executables that negatively affect the user experience. Malware and unwanted software are either downloadable binaries or applications that run on a website and affect site visitors. You can see a list of any suspected files hosted on your site in the Security Issues report.

Malware is any software or mobile application specifically designed to harm a computer, a mobile device, the software it's running, or its users. Malware exhibits malicious behavior that can include installing software without user consent and installing harmful software such as viruses. Website owners sometimes don't realize that their downloadable files are considered malware, so these binaries might be hosted inadvertently.

Unwanted software is an executable file or mobile application that engages in behavior that is deceptive, unexpected, or that negatively affects the user's browsing or computing experience. Examples include software that switches your home page or other browser settings to ones you don't want, or apps that leak private and personal information without proper disclosure.

For more on how Google helps protect users from unwanted software, see That's not the download you're looking for... in our Google Online Security Blog.

Ensure that your site or application follows the guidelines, then you can request a review in the Security Issues report.

If your mobile application is showing warnings, you can file an appeal.

Be sure that you don't violate the Unwanted Software Policy, and follow the guidelines given here. Though this list isn't comprehensive, these behaviors can cause apps and websites to display warnings to users upon downloading and visiting. You can see a list of any suspected files hosted on your site in the Security Issues report.

Inform users of your intent to collect their data. Provide users an opportunity to agree to the collection of their data before you start collecting and sending it from the device, including data about third-party accounts, email, phone number, installed apps, and files on the mobile device. Make sure you securely handle any personal or sensitive user data that you collect, including being transmitted using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS). For non-Play apps, you must disclose your data collection to the user in the app. For Google Play apps, disclosure must adhere to Play policy.

- Key best practices

The Google Search Essentials make up the core parts of what makes your web-based content (web pages, images, videos, or other publicly-available material that Google finds on the web) eligible to appear and perform well on Google Search:

It doesn't cost any money to appear in Google Search results, no matter what anyone tries to tell you. It's important to note that just because a page meets all of these requirements and best practices, doesn't mean that Google will crawl, index, or serve its content. Learn more about How Search Works.

The technical requirements cover the bare minimum that Google Search needs from a web page in order to show it in search results. There are actually very few technical things you need to do to a web page; most sites pass the technical requirements without even realizing it.

The spam policies detail the behaviors and tactics that can lead to a page or an entire site being ranked lower or completely omitted from Google Search. Sites that focus on providing the best content and experience for people and uphold the spirit of our principles are more likely to do well in Google Search results.

While there are many things you can do to improve your site's SEO, there are a few core practices that can have the most impact on your web content's ranking and appearance on Google Search:

## Prevent user-generated spam on your site and platform

**URL:** https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/prevent-abuse

**Contents:**
- Prevent user-generated spam on your site and platform
- Tell users that you don't allow spam on your service
- Identify spammy accounts
- Use manual approval for suspicious user interactions
- Use a blocklist to prevent repetitive spamming attempts
- Block automated account creation
- Monitor your service for abuse

Spammers often take advantage of open comment forms and other user generated content inputs and generate spammy content on an unsuspecting victim site. Hosting platforms may be similarly open to abuse; spammers may create a large number of sites that violate our spam policies and add little or no value to the web.

Preventing abuse on your platform or site is usually not hard. Even simple deterrents such as an unusual challenge users have to complete before interacting with your property may discourage spammers.

Publish a clear abuse policy and communicate it to your users, for example during the sign-up process. Furthermore, allow trusted users to report content on your property that they consider spammy.

Keep a record of signups and other user interactions with your platform, and try to identify typical spam patterns, such as:

These signals may help you create a user reputation system, which can not only help you engage users, but it can also help identify spammers. Since many comment spammers want their content in search engines, consider adding the noindex robots meta tag on posts that come from new users that don't have any reputation on your platform. Then, after some time, when the user gains reputation, you can allow their content to be indexed. This will greatly demotivate spammers from interacting with your platform.

Since oftentimes spammers are motivated by leaving a link to their site, consider adding a nofollow or ugc rel attribute to all links in untrusted content.

Manual approval (or moderation) for certain user interactions can decrease spam on your platform considerably by preventing spammers to instantly create content that may be spam. Moderation adds overhead to your daily workflows, however it's a very effective way of fighting spam. Its efficacy is why, for example, comment moderation is a built-in feature in most CMSes.

Once you find a single spammy profile, make it simple to remove any others. For example, if you see several spammy profiles coming from the same IP address, you can add that IP address to a permanent ban list. For CMSes (for example, WordPress), there are plugins like Akismet that can help, but adding the IP address to your firewall's deny list can be very effective also.

In your sign-up form, consider using reCAPTCHAs or similar verification tools to only allow human submissions and prevent automated scripts from generating a lot of sites on your hosting service.

In the context of Google Search, spam refers to techniques used to deceive users or manipulate our Search systems into ranking content highly. Our spam policies help protect users and improve the quality of Search results. To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn't violate Google Search's overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page. These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.

We detect policy-violating practices both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a manual action. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.

If you believe that a site is violating Google's spam policies, let us know by filing a search quality user report. We're focused on developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and we'll use these reports to further improve our spam detection systems.

Our policies cover common spam practices, but Google may act against any type of spam practices we detect.

Cloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users. Examples of cloaking include:

If your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript or images, see our recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without cloaking.

If a site is hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack harder for the site owner to detect. Read more about fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.

If you operate a paywall or a content-gating mechanism, we don't consider this to be cloaking if Google can see the full content of what's behind the paywall just like any person who has access to the gated material and if you follow our Flexible Sampling general guidance.

Doorway abuse is when sites or pages are created to rank for specific, similar search queries. They lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Examples of doorway abuse include:

Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to manipulate search rankings by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to:

## Debugging drops in Google Search traffic

**URL:** https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/debugging-search-traffic-drops#large

**Contents:**
- Debugging drops in Google Search traffic
- Main causes for drops in organic Search traffic
  - Algorithmic update
  - Small drop in position
  - Large drop in position
  - Technical issues
  - Security issues
  - Spam issues
  - Seasonality and changing interests
  - Site moves and migrations

A drop in organic Search traffic can happen for several reasons, and it may not be straightforward to understand what exactly happened to your site. This guide explains how to use the Search Console Performance report and Google Trends to investigate the reasons for a drop in Search traffic and how to address it.

To get an idea of what is affecting your Search traffic, check the sketches in the image. They show roughly what could potentially affect your traffic and how your graph shape would look like.

Large drop from an algorithmic update, site-wide security or spam issue

Technical issue across your site, changing interests

Reporting glitch ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The following sections cover the main causes you should investigate when analyzing a traffic drop. Also make sure to check the Search Console Data Anomalies page to see if there is anything applicable to your site. The drop might be related to a change in the data processing or a logging error.

Google is always improving how it assesses content and updating its search ranking and serving algorithms accordingly; core updates and other smaller updates may change how some pages perform in Google Search results. We post about notable improvements to our systems on our list of ranking updates page; check it to see if there's anything that's applicable to your site.

If you suspect a drop in traffic is due to an algorithmic update, it's important to understand that there might not be anything fundamentally wrong with your content. To determine whether you need to make a change, review your top pages in Search Console and assess how they were ranking:

A small drop in position is when there's a small shift in position in the top results (for example, dropping from position 2 to 4 for a search query). In Search Console, you might see a noticeable drop in traffic without a big change in impressions.

Small fluctuations in position can happen at any time (including moving back up in position, without you needing to do anything). In fact, we recommend avoiding making radical changes if your page is already performing well.

A large drop in position is when you see a notable drop out of the top results for a wide range of terms (for example, dropping from the top 10 results to position 29).

In cases like this, self-assess your whole website overall (not just individual pages) to make sure it's helpful, reliable and people-first. If you've made changes to your site, it may take time to see an effect: some changes c

- Doorway abuse
- Expired domain abuse
- Hacked content

In the context of Google Search, spam refers to techniques used to deceive users or manipulate our Search systems into ranking content highly. Our spam policies help protect users and improve the quality of Search results. To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn't violate Google Search's overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page. These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.

We detect policy-violating practices both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a manual action. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.

## Get started with Google Trends

**URL:** https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/trends-start

**Contents:**
- Get started with Google Trends
- About Google Trends
- Monitoring rising trends
  - General trends
  - Specific trends
- Performing keyword research
- Creating a content calendar
- Benchmarking against your industry
- Analyzing brand awareness and sentiment

Google Trends can help you better understand how people find information on Google Search, which can help you to develop your content strategy and refine how you talk to your audience.

Google Trends provides a random sample of aggregated, anonymized, and categorized Google and YouTube searches. It lets you analyze interest in a particular query or topic from around the globe or at city-level geography. If you're interested in learning more about what's available, check the FAQ about Google Trends data.

Google Trends has two main tools for you to pull and analyze data:

To learn more about how to navigate these tools, watch the Google Trends walkthrough and the other videos in the Google Trends Tutorials series.

You can use the Trending Now page to monitor what's been trending recently, and the Explore page to check what are the rising or top terms and topics for different locations, date ranges, categories, and Google properties.

If you know a search term or topic is rising, consider if it applies to your industry and your target audience. Think about how you can discuss a topic and bring value about the topic in a way that resonates with your audience; take a look at the content that's already out there and consider if writing about this topic on your site would be useful to your audience. For example, if you manage a clothing department store, you could check when new brands are starting to rise; if you cover sports for a news company, you can check when important athletes are in the media; or if you sell computers, you can check which models are getting more popular.

There are two main approaches to monitoring rising trends, depending on whether you're looking at general changes in search interest, or changes that are specific to your site.

Here are two ways of looking for general trends:

To explore trends specific to your website, compile a list of terms you're already interested in and search for them using the Explore tool. For example, if you have a cheese store, you could check what types of cheese people are searching for to make sure you're offering them in your store. Here's an example of how a chart may look like for Brie, Cheddar, Provolone, Parmesan, and Mozzarella.

In this example, the topics include data that's related to each type of cheese, not just the search terms. Topics aggregate across languages and include misspellings, variations, and acronyms related to it. This can be useful, especially in this case if the terms you are s
